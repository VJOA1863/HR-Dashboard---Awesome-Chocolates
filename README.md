# HR Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyses HR data using **Power BI** to understand workforce composition, compensation patterns, leave behaviour, and organisational growth.

The dashboard is intentionally structured with:
- **One executive overview page** for quick, high-level insights
- **Multiple supporting pages** to answer detailed HR questions without cluttering the main view

This reflects how dashboards are used in real organisations: **overview first, deep-dive when needed**.

---

## Business Objectives
The dashboard was built to help HR teams and management:
- Understand the current **workforce structure**
- Analyse **salary distribution** and compensation ranges
- Identify **demographic patterns** across employees
- Monitor **leave balances** and long-leave risk
- Track **hiring and workforce growth trends**
- Support **data-driven workforce planning and reporting**

---

## Key Business Questions Answered

The dashboard answers the following HR and workforce-related questions:

1. What is the current total headcount of the organisation?
2. How are employees distributed across different job roles?
3. What does the gender distribution of the workforce look like?
4. How is the workforce spread across different age groups?
5. What is the average salary across the organisation?
6. How does salary vary by job title?
7. What are the minimum and maximum salary ranges for each role?
8. How does employee qualification relate to salary levels?
9. What is the current leave balance across employees and roles?
10. How many employees are at risk of long leave accumulation (e.g. leave balance greater than 20 days)?
11. Who are the top and bottom earners in the organisation?
12. How has the organisation grown over time in terms of employee hiring?

These questions are answered using a combination of executive-level KPIs and supporting analysis pages.

## Dashboard Structure

### 1. HR Overview (Main Page)
The main dashboard page provides an executive-level snapshot, including:
- Total headcount
- Average salary
- Average leave balance
- Employees with leave balance greater than 20 days
- Role distribution
- Gender distribution
- Age distribution
- Hiring and workforce growth trend

**Purpose:**  
Answer the question: **“What is the current state of our workforce?”**

---

### 2. Supporting Analysis Pages
To maintain clarity and usability, additional pages were created to answer detailed questions such as:
- Salary distribution by job title (minimum, maximum, and average)
- Headcount by role
- Identification of top and bottom earners
- Leave balance patterns by role
- Drill-down views to support deeper HR analysis

**Purpose:**  
Answer the question: **“Why do these numbers look the way they do, and where should HR focus next?”**

---

## Key Insights (Examples)

- Workforce headcount is distributed across multiple roles, with clear variation by job function.
- Salary levels differ significantly by role and qualification, highlighting the importance of structured compensation bands.
- Leave balance analysis helps identify potential long-leave risk areas requiring proactive planning.
- Hiring trends show steady workforce growth, supporting future resource and capacity planning.

> Note: Insights are intended to demonstrate how the dashboard supports decision-making; real actions would depend on specific organisational context.
